\section{More questions for discussion and review.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The design of which machine influenced the design
    of the control statements in FORTRAN?
 
 \begin{answer}

    IBM 704.

    \end{answer}



  \item How many different kinds of control statements
    must the designer of a programming language include
    in a language?

  \begin{answer}

    If you include a GOTO statement, you only need one.  If you do not use a GOTO, you only need a small number of control statements.

    \end{answer}



  \item What is the one question that applies in the
    design of all statements that allow selection or
    iteration?
  
\begin{answer}

   Should the control structure have multiple entries?

    \end{answer}



  \item What is an advantage of requiring that
    the \textbf{then} and \textbf{else} clauses of
    an \textbf{if} statement be compound statements?

  \begin{answer}

    Readability is greatly increase with the addition of required then clauses.

    \end{answer}


  \item How does the \textbf{switch} statement in C\#
    differ from the \textbf{switch} statement in Java?

  \begin{answer}

   The C# switch statement differs from that of its C-based predecessors
in two ways. First, C# has a static semantics rule that disallows the implicit
execution of more than one segment.  Secondly, with C, if there is no break at the end of the selected segment, execution continues into the next segment.

    \end{answer}


  \item Distinguish between 2 statements in Ruby
    that correspond to Java's \textbf{switch} statement.

  \begin{answer}

    Ruby has two forms of multiple-selection constructs, both of which are called case expressions. One is semanticaclly similar to nested if statements, and the other is form is similar to the switch of java.

    \end{answer}


  \item Features of a programming language sometimes persist
    longer than a feature of computing hardware that inspired
    and supported that part of the language's design.
    Similarly, features of hardware sometimes persist longer
    than some parts of a language's design that were created
    to take advantage of that feature in hardware.

    Give examples.

  \begin{answer}

    LISP was orginally created for use on an IBM 704.  The 704's memory had two fields, decrement and address.  That is LISP included instructions such as CAR, CDR. These provided efficient list selectors.

    \end{answer}


  \item Who most famously warned of the dangers of using the
    \textbf{goto} statement? What did Donald Knuth have to
    say about the use of the \textbf{goto} statement?

  \begin{answer}

   Edsger Dijkstra noted “The goto statement as it stands is just too primitive; it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one’s program.” Donald Knuth argued there were occasions when the efficiency of the goto outweighed its harm to readability 

    \end{answer}


  \item Describes Ada's \textbf{for} loop. Are there some
    kinds of iteration that might be easier in Ada than
    in Java? Easier in Java than in Ada?

  \begin{answer}

    In Ada the counter variabel cannot be changed in the body of the loop. In Java, the counter can be edited in the body. Also, you gain flexibilty by allowing you to edit any part of the loop.

    \end{answer}


  \item What does it mean to say that the guarded commands
    of Ada are non-deterministic?

  \begin{answer}

 Guarded commands in Ada are nondeterministically chosen for execution when more than one of the statements are evaluated to true. This means that if there are three guarded statements and two of the three evaluate to true, then each time the program will use one of the two statements. It will not always use the one that appears first nor the one that appears last, but rather it will choose between them non-deterministically or randomly.

    \end{answer}


  \item The header files in a C program contain function
    prototypes. What is a function prototype?

  \begin{answer}

    In computer programming, a function prototype or function interface is a declaration of a function that specifies the function's name and type signature (arity, parameter types, and return type), but omits the function body. 

    \end{answer}


  \item Every method in a Ruby program belongs to a class.
    A programmer can place a definition of a method inside
    the definition of a class or outside of the definition
    of any class that the programmer writes. To which class
    does the method belong in the second case?

  \begin{answer}

   If a method is defined outside of the definition of any class that the programmer writes then the method belongs to the root object, Object.

    \end{answer}


  \item Distinguish between positional and keyword parameters.

  \begin{answer}

Positional parameters are bound based on the order in which they are given to the function. Keyword parameters are when the name of the formal parameter to which an actual parameter is to be bound is specified with the actual parameter in a call. This allows them to be input in any order.

    \end{answer}


  \item Ruby blocks are closures. What does that mean?

  \begin{answer}

A closure is an anonymous function which can be passed as a parameter. Also, Ruby doesn't nest scope, so variables defined in a method are not accessible outside of the method (say, in the class which defines them).

    \end{answer}


  \item What is a pure function?

  \begin{answer}

    A pure function is a function where the return value is only determined by its input values, without observable side effects.

    \end{answer}


  \item Some languages give programmers means to define
    both functions and procedures. Java doe not. Is that
    a serious limitation?

  \begin{answer}

   It does not seem to be a serious limitation, it just means that performing procedures in Java is more verbose because it requires that the programmer instantiate the class with any needed methods.

    \end{answer}


  \item Declarations of formal parameters in an Ada procedure
    can include, in addition to the names and types of the
    parameters, reserved words that do not appear in declarations
    in Java programs. 
    What is the purpose of those reserved words?
 
  \begin{answer}

Ada allows the programmer to specify in mode, out mode, and inout mode for each formal parameter.  This means that they can receive data from the actual parameter, they can send data to the actual parameter, or they can do both.

    \end{answer}


  \item The C language imposes a constraint upon programmers
    who want to pass a multidimensional array to a function.
    What is the constraint? How did the design of the Java
    programming language eliminate that constraint for 
    programmers who use that language?

  \begin{answer}

In C, programmers are required to pass the length of an array to a method. Specifying the length of an array (like in C) is unnecessary because Java arrays store a pointer to an address containing their length. 

    \end{answer}


  \item An activation record contains a return
    address, a dynamic link, parameters, and
    local variables.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item To what does the return address point?
    \item To what does the dynamic link point?
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{answer}

The return address usually consists of a pointer to the instruction following the call in the code segment of the calling program unit.  The dynamic link points to the base of the activation record instance of the caller.

    \end{answer}


  \item The stack will contain multiple activation
    records for a single subprogram under what
    circumstances?

  \begin{answer}

In a recursive program there can be multiple activation records (although they will be incomplete) for a single subprogram.

    \end{answer}


  \item How (or why?) does the LIFO protocol apply to
    calls to and returns from subprograms?

  \begin{answer}

LIFO allows for subprograms to be nested within one another and for subprograms to be used as parameters within other subprograms.

    \end{answer}


  \item Which important development in computer architecture
    has changed the way that the stack is used in some
    systems for facilitating calls to and returns from
    subprograms?

  \begin{answer}

 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) machines have parameters passed in registers in their compilers because RISC machines have more registers than CISC (complex instruction set computing) machines. Chapter 10 assumes parameters are passed in the stack though, as they had been in CISC machines.


    \end{answer}


  \item A dynamic chain contains a history of what?

  \begin{answer}

   Dynamic chain represents the dynamic history of how execution got to its current position, which is always in the subprogram code whose activation record instance is on top of the stack.

    \end{answer}


  \item Which two numbers are needed to compute
    the address of a local variable in a subprogram?

  \begin{answer}

To compute the address of a local variable you need the (chain Offset, local Offset) pair.


    \end{answer}


  \item How does a Ruby module differ from a class?

  \begin{answer}
Modules are unlike classes in that they cannot be instantiated or subclassed and do not define variables. Methods that are defined in a module include the  module’s name in their names.

    \end{answer}


  \item Memory for variables can be allocated on the heap
    and on the stack. In which place or places is memory
    allocated for objects in C++? in Java?

  \begin{answer}

In C++, variables can be allocated to the heap either by making them “static” or by allocating memory with the keyword “new”. However, variables which are initialized during the execution of a function are allocated to the stack. Java behaves the same way. 

    \end{answer}


  \item What problems were solved by the addition
    of genericity to Java?

  \begin{answer}

    They allow a type or method to operate on objects of various types while providing compile-time type safety.

    \end{answer}


  \item What is the purpose of the static chain?

  \begin{answer}

   A static chain is a chain of static links that connect certain activation record instances in the stack. The static chain connects all the static ancestors of an executing subprogram, in order of static parent first. This chain can obviously be used to implement the accesses to nonlocal variables in static-scoped languages. 

    \end{answer}


  \item What is a singleton?

  \begin{answer}

   In object-oriented programming , a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time. 

    \end{answer}


  \item What are the two parts of the definition 
    of an abstract data type?

  \begin{answer}

   (1) a type definition that allows program units to declare variables of the type but hides the representation of objects of the type; and (2) a set of operations for manipulating objects of the type.

    \end{answer}


  \end{enumerate}
